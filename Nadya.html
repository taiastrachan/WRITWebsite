She is the Founder and Executive Director of PERIOD (period.org), an organization she founded at the age of 16. PERIOD is now the largest youth-run NGO in women's health, and one of the fastest growing ones here in the United States. Since 2014 they have addressed over 700,000 periods and registered over 500 campus chapters in all 50 states and 30 other countries. In 2017, Nadya ran for office in Cambridge, MA.

Nadya recently published her debut book, Period Power: A Manifesto for the Menstrual Movement with publisher Simon & Schuster, which made the Kirkus Reviews list for Best Young Adult Nonfiction of 2018. Nadya is the Chief Brand Officer of JUV Consulting, a Generation Z marketing agency based in NYC.
